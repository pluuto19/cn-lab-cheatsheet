------------------------------ TELNET -----------------------------------------

- en
- conf t
- int vlan 1
- ip add 192.168.1.1
- no sh
- exit
- line vty 0 15
- pass <switch-access-pass> [the password that will be used to TELNET into the switch]
- login
- exit
- enable pass <priviledged access mode pass> [the password that will be used to put the switch into priviledge mode after TELNETTING into it]

------------------------------ SSH -----------------------------------------

- hostname router1
- ip domain name final-lab
- crypto key generate rsa
- 1024
- ip ssh version 2
- line vty 0 15
- transport input ssh
- exit
- username pluuto secret abc123
- line vty 0 15
- login local

------------------------------ SUBNETTING THEORY -----------------------------------------

- classful addressing: 
- 5 IP classes, each with a pre-defined default subnet mask. CAN NOT
- further break a subnet into smaller subnets.
- e.g, 120.137.0.1, an IP of class A, has a default mask of 255.0.0.0. This IP can have
- 256*2556*256 IPs. We can not create more subnets of this 120.0.0.0 network.
- 192.130.10.15, an IP of class C, has a default mask of 255.255.255.0. This network
- (192.130.10.0) can only have 256 usable IPs.
- Note: How many hosts an IP address can have is specified by the mask. In case of 
- 120.137.0.1, the network was 120.0.0.0 as specified by the subnet mask. So, 256^3
- usable IPs. In case of 192.130.10.15, the network was 192.130.10.0 as specified by
- the mask. So 256 IPs only.

- classless addressing:
- no concept of classes, any IP address can be given any subnet mask. Not just /8, /16
- /24 as was with classful addressing. 

------------------------------ RIP v1/v2 -----------------------------------------

- router rip
- version 2 [dont include this if dont want to enable RIPv2]
- network 192.168.0.0 [a /24 network connected to one of the interfaces of the router]
- network 10.0.0.0 [a /8 point-to-point network that connects one router to another router]

------------------------------ OSPF -----------------------------------------

- router ospf 1
- network 120.137.0.1 0.255.255.255 area 0 [0.255.255.255 is a wildcard. Basically, just reverse the subnet bits. So, where class A has a default subnet of 255.0.0.0, it's wildcard will be 0.255.255.255. Same technique will be used for getting a wildcard of a subnetted mask]
